    <h1>Data Science</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <b>Data science</b> is an interdisciplinary academic field[1] that uses
      statistics, scientific computing, scientific
      <strong> methods,</strong> processing, scientific visualization,
      algorithms and systems to extract or extrapolate knowledge from
      potentially noisy, structured, or unstructured data.[2]
    </p>
    <p>
      Data science also <mark> integrates domain </mark> knowledge from the
      underlying <del>application domain</del> (e.g., natural sciences,
      information technology, and medicine).[3] Data science is multifaceted and
      can be described as a science, a research paradigm, a research method, a
      discipline, a workflow, and a profession.[4] <br /><br />
      Data science is "a concept to unify statistics, data analysis,
      informatics, and their related methods" to "understand and analyze actual
      phenomena" with data.[5] It uses techniques and theories drawn from many
      fields within the context of mathematics, statistics, computer science,
      information science, and domain knowledge.[6] However, data science is
      different from computer science and information science. Turing Award
      winner Jim Gray imagined data science as a "fourth paradigm" of science
      (empirical, theoretical, computational, and now data-driven) and asserted
      that "everything about science is changing because of the impact of
      information technology" and the data deluge.[7][8] <br /><br /><br />
